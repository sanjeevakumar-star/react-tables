    <p>ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used to build the user interface for Web Applications.
         It is responsible only for the view layer of the application. It provides developers to compose complex
          UIs from a small and isolated piece of code called "components." ReactJS made of two parts first is components, 
          that are the pieces that contain HTML code and what you want to see in the user interface, and the second 
          one is HTML document where all your components will be rendered.</p>
