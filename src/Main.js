    <p>A ReactJS web application is made up of multiple components, and each component has its own logic and controls. 
        These components are responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code which can be reused wherever you need 
        them. The reusable code helps to make your apps easier to develop and maintain. These Components can be nested
         with other components to allow complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. ReactJS uses virtual
          DOM based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM. The virtual DOM works fast as it only changes individual
         DOM elements instead of reloading complete DOM every time.</p>
    
    </div>
